create the class Song with below attributes.

songId - int 
title - String
artist -  String
duration-double

The above attributes should be private, getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required. 

Create class MyClass with main method. Implement two static methods - findSongDurationForArtist and
getSongsInAscendingOrder in MyClass class.

findSongDurationForArtist method: 
----------------------------------------------------
This method will take two input parameters of Song objects and String parameter.
The method will return the sum of song duration from array of Song object for the given artist (String parameter passed).

If no Song with the given artist is present in the array of Song objects, then the method should return zero.

getSongsInAscendingOrder method: 
----------------------------------------------------
This method will take input parameters array, of Song objects and String parameter.The method will return Song objects array 
in an ascending order of their duration, from the array of Song objects whose artist attribute matches with the input String 
parameter. 

If no Song with the given artist is present in the array of Song objects, then the method should return null.

Note: 
----------
1. No two Song object would have the same songid.
2. Combination of artist and duration should be unique.
3. All the searches should be case insensitive.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For getfindSongDuration ForArtist method - in method should print the sum of duration of artist as it is, if the returned 
value is greater than 0 or it should print "There are no songs with given artist".

For getSongsinAscendingOrder method - The main method should print the song id and title from the returned song object array 
if the returned value is not null. If the returned value is null then it should print "There are no songs with given artist".


For Example,

112
ABC

where 112 is song ld. ABC is song title.

Before calling these static methods in main, use. Scanner object to read the values of five Song objects referring attributes 
in the above mentioned attribute sequence. Next, read two String values for capturing artists.
